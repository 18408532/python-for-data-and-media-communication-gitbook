## Delete key from Git? Regenerate key on Twitter?

Since Git remembers the whole history, the key can still be found later. The simplest is to check the [file changes](https://github.com/hupili/python-for-data-and-media-communication/pull/12/files), or commit detail page. If that key is on a test account, things should be fine. However, if that key is on a personal account, you may want to [regenerate one pair on Twitter](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/basics/authentication/guides/securing-keys-and-tokens.html).
