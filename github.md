## Host open data sets on GitHub

Open datasets contains three parts:

1. The dataset, in format of `.csv`, `.json`, or a directory of those files.
2. The scripts involved for generating the dataset, e.g. scraper, data cleaning logics, data transformations. See [Dataprep](dataprep.md) for more information.
3. A `README.md` to show the basic information of this dataset.

Create a new file called `README.md`:

Write the description file which usually contains introduction of data source, the background of research, data fields, and data size, and license. If you do not know what licenses are available, we suggest you to use [CC 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/).
