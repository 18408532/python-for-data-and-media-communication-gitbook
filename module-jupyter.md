# Jupyter notebook

It is suggested to enter virtual environment before using Jupyter notebook.

```
pyvenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

When you see `(venv)` appear in front of your command line prompt, that means the you are in the virtual environment. Always check this prefix to make sure you are working in the right environment. You can use `deactive` command to exit current virtual environment.

Now you can install and enter Jupyter notebook:

```
pip3 install jupyter
jupyter notebook
```

By default the notebook will be available at http://localhost:8888/tree
