GitBook's account system failed multiple access in spring 2018. I lost access to the original GitBook project. This is a dump at April 22, 2018. The books in this repository will not be regularly updated. Learning materials, e.g. books and codes, will be updated in the main repo: https://github.com/hupili/python-for-data-and-media-communication/

The course COMM7780/JOUR7280 Big Data for Media and Communication is setup for master students in the school of communication, Hong Kong Baptist University. The purpose of this course is to motivate the students to become a [T-shape talent](http://www.caseinterview.com/t-shaped-skills) in communications field. The course involves intensive training of Python and quest in solving practical problems. This GitBook collects all the materials related with lab exercises covering basic Python, data scraping, table manipulation and data mining. Every week, one group of students will apply that week's knowledge into a real problem from their own domain.
