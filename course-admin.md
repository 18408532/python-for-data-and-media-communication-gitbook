## Q: Is it mandatory to own a MAC Notebook in order to attend this course?

A: No. Some of our TAs and class helpers use Windows and they can help you to setup the environment. There will be some difference between the two operating systems but once the environment is setup, most coding part will be the same. Besides, our classroom/ lab (CVA517 for F19 sessions) has MAC computers for you to use.
