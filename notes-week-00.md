# Chapter 0: Introdution and Preparation

## Foreward

The course COMM7780/JOUR7280 Big Data for Media and Communication is set up for master students in the school of communication, Hong Kong Baptist University. The purpose of this course is to motivate the students to become a [T-shape talent](http://www.caseinterview.com/t-shaped-skills) in communications field. The course involves intensive training of Python and quest in solving practical problems. This open book collects all the materials related with lab exercises covering Python basics, data scraping, table manipulation and data mining. Students also apply their duly learned knowledge to write data-driven reports on a regular basis.

The final projects of past students can be found in this archive GitHub organisation: https://github.com/data-projects-archive/

## Chapter introduction

This chapter covers "GitHub literacy" and walks the readers through the basic steps towards an open source experience.

## Getting-started on GitHub
You can sign up in [Github](https://github.com/). Pick a nice name, then you can start your wonderful journey conquering the galaxy of data and codes. There are many useful learning materials and meaningful projects in the platform waiting for you to open it, many interesting stories to discover.

### Understand markdown
Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling all forms of writing on the GitHub platform. - explanation by Github. Markdown is a way to style text on the web. You control the display of the document; formatting words as bold or italic, adding images, and creating lists are just a few of the things we can do with Markdown. Mostly, Markdown is just regular text with a few non-alphabetic characters thrown in, like # or *.
* Here is the official document of [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) in Github.
* Also, another good introduction of use of markdown [Markdown 基本语法](https://github.com/younghz/Markdown)


### Use GitHub issue tracker as discussion forum
The GitHub issue has a lot of features, but overall it looks like a lightweight collaboration system. Assignee or project manager can pull requests for new contributors and set a to-do list for contributors and teammates. You can use issue to ask questions, discuss with your team, label the `issue` you encounter, and collaborate with others, which greatly advances the managing of a Project.
e.g.1: Set a to-do list for your teammates, once they finished the quest you pull, they can just tick to show the progress.

e.g.2：To discuss with your team members to track the working process.


### Learn other's code from commit history

You can see the latest update time and a brief summary of every piece of work in one's repository.

By clicking one of the files, you can see the details of the improvements and changes they recently made, and you can learn from their work. 
The red blocks represent the old one, and the green is the newer one, which makes it easy for you to know the difference and learn the logic behind it.
### Preview a Jupyter notebook hosted on GitHub with nbviewer
* [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/)  
The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. In our course, Jupyter notebook will be our daily tool to write, test, and sharing our codes and works. It's very useful for us to learn and make **reproducible works**.

    The good advantage of jupyter notebook includes
    * The Notebook has support for over 40 programming languages, including Python, R, Julia, and Scala.
    * Notebooks can be shared with others using email, Dropbox, GitHub and the Jupyter Notebook Viewer.
    * Your code can produce rich, interactive output: HTML, images, videos, LaTeX, and custom MIME types.

* [Nbviewer](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/)  
Nbviewer creates a simple way to view and share Jupyter Notebooks. You just need to copy the link of one Jupyter notebook and paste in nbviewer.
