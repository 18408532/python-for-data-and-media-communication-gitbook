## Distribution

### Histogram and KDE

#### [O] How histograms can be cheating

Try to adjust number of bins and bin boundaries to see what happens.

### Special points in distribution

- Mean
- Max/ Min
- Median
- Percentile

* `seaborn`
* `matplotlib` 

## Articulate central tendency and spread of data

### Variance, skewness, kurtosis

## Correlation

### Continuous: Scatter plot and correlation

### Discrete: Cross-tab and correlation

### From correlation to causality

## [O] (Statistical) Hypothesis testing
