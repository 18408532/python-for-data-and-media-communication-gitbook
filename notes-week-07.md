# Week 7 - Text analysis 

### Check the information in terminal
* `which pip3`is to learn where is pip3 in your computer. You can also input `which pip`to know the location of pip.

* `ls -l` means to list the files in the mode of listing with details.

From the above screenshot, you can find that Python equals to python3.6 and the same as python3. Pip does not equal to pip3.

* `cat` to check the content to verify if they are the same.

Obviously, they are the same.

* You can also drag the pip file and pip3 file into the Visual Studio Code,after you use `which` to know their location.

### Simple steps to use Jupyter notebook.

##### 4 Steps
* Step1
`pyvenv venv` means create a virtual environment(venv) folder called 'venv'. You can change the folder's name as you like, like `pyvenv BIGDATA`. 
    Be careful where you create the folder.

* Step2 
`source venv/bin/activate` means activate the virtual environment. Then you will see the '(venv)',which means you are in a virtual environment.

You can `deactivate` the virtual environment.

* Step3
```
pip install jupyter
pip install requests
```

* Step4
`Jupyter notebook` to open notebook.

##### New

* If you are in the same computer, or on your own laptop, you don't need to totally follow the 4 steps. 


* Pili's virtual environment folder is 'environment'. So if he restart his computer, he can just 
```
source enviroment/bin/activate
Jupyter notebook
```

### For loop.

##### Range()
* Function 'Range' has 3 parameters. From XX to XX with the step size XX.  
The 3rd parameter is the step size. If you don't input the 3rd one, it will take 1 in default.

The parameters can be negative.

* 'i' is defined in the whole coding,from the beginning of 'import' to the end of the coding, not only inside for loop.

* If you define sth inside the `def`, the definition will only work inside the def.

##### Append VS Extend

* In the for loop, i will be 10, 8 then 6 and 4 at last. Only the last value is left.

* `append` means add. Every time you have an 'i', you add it into the 'pages' list.

>![](/assets/Screen Shot 2018-03-14 at 9.29.07 pm.png)

* `append` means that the whole list is appended as an element, or one item.

* `extend` means extract the items and add those items into the new list.

### Verify every step
* 

### Pandas plotting
* Please learn to learn from others by google.

* Pandas can be more powerful than excel.First of all,let's start from the excel function.
