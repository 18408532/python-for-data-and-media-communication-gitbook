Try `control+r` to conduct a search in command history.

## Visual Studio Code

`command+/` make code selected become comment/uncomment

### tab for auto completion

### "command"+s: save the code

This is equivalent by executing your code from the Terminal.

## Chrome

The `JSONView` extension can help to structure and highlight JSON. In this way, it is easier to read the JSON response from common APIs.
