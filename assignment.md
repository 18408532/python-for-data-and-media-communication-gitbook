# Assignments

Following are the **individual** assignments.

## Way to hand in assignments

- Create an repo called `python-data-assignments`. (Pleas copy and paste to ensure the exact repo name; or we may not find your assignment)
- Create one folder for each assignment, with names `assignment1`, `assignment2` and `assignment3`.
- Put all the relevant files, including codes, docs and data (where applicable) into the per assignment folder. Refer to [notes-week-00.md](notes-week-00.md) for GitHub operations.

**Note**: You need to ensure the work is on GitHub before the deadline. Although we don't grade immediately after submission close, we can always check back the status at that time from version history.
