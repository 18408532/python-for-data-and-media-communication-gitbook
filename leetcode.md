Leetcode is a programming training website specially designed for Internet companies. The target audience is generally computer science background students. The problems on leetcode may involve some advanced data structure (more than `list`, `dict` stuffs you learn here) and advanced algorithms. A common heuristic is that, once you can finish first 200 random leedcode, you have very good chance to get into tier one Internet companies in the world. We do not require our students to be as proficient as that. However, this is the place to get you started with "computational thinking". We curate the following list with annotations for those curious minds. You can use the following list to test your basic Python knowledge.

Most of the those problems below are labelled "Easy" on leetcode. We re-estimate their difficulty using 5-stars taking our student background into consideration. The 1-star and 2-star problems are meant to be tractable by an average students from the class. The 3-star and 4-star problem require extra efforts but within your reach most of the time. You are suggested to strike to 4-star problems in order to gain good efficiency. That helps in the long run, if you want to pursue a data analyst career after graduation. 5-star problems touch the surface of "algorithm design". It is an advanced topic that even some computer science students do not feel comfortable with. You are **strongly** suggested to find a mentor who can give you some general directions before you start, or it is highly like to be a waste of time (no meaninful results after hours/ days)...

## Control flow

- ★★☆☆☆ [lemonade-change](https://leetcode.com/problems/lemonade-change/) - involves `for`, `if` and variables. A very realistic problem in our life. Good to exercise logical thinking.

## String

- ★★★★☆ [license-key-formatting](https://leetcode.com/problems/license-key-formatting/) - involves `str` functions, integer division's quotient and remainder. Requires a bit sense of math.

## Algorithms

Algorithm problems are usually integrated practice of all the above. We do not label the Python basics involved in the problems anymore.

- ★★★★★ [degree-of-an-array](https://leetcode.com/problems/degree-of-an-array) - requires good problem comprehension and problem conversion. Design staged solution once you can re-interpret the problem as: _among the most common numbers, find the one whose minimum index and maximum index are closest_.
